	<h2>Description:</h2>
	<p>All be honest, going into this with recipe testing I was thinking 
	it would more so be a recipe the kids would love – but it turns out that 
	equally as well adults will absolutely love this French bread pizza too!
	</p>
	<p>It has incredible flavor, perfect texture 
	(crisp exterior, soft interior) and it’s so easy to customize 
	(see below for ideas, or just think of your favorite creative pizza and make 
	that here!).
	Not only is it a great after school snack, but it is definitely something I 
	would proudly serve to guests on the weekend (just pair it with a simple salad 
	topped with Spaghetti Factory copycat creamy pesto dressing).
	</p>
	<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>French bread: Use soft crusted french bread </li>
			<li>Pizza sauce</li>
			<li>Mozzarella</li>
			<li>Parmesan cheese</li>
			<li>Olive Oil</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Steps:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Prepare oven, and baking sheet: Move oven rack up 
			one level and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Line a rimmed 18 by 13-inch baking 
			sheet with aluminum foil for easier clean up if desired.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Cut bread: Cut french bread in half evenly through 
			the length, to create two long portions. Cut each portion in half and place on 
			baking sheet.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Brush bread with oil, lightly toast: Brush both 
			sides with olive oil. Turn upright and bake in preheat oven 4 minutes.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Add toppings: Spread pizza sauce over each piece,
 			sprinkle evenly with mozzarella and parmesan cheeses, then finish with 
			desired toppings.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Bake again: Bake in preheated oven until cheese is fully 
			melted, about 10- 13 minutes. If you’d like it more browned then broil 
			during the last 1 minute or so (keep a close eye on it!).</li>
		</ol>
