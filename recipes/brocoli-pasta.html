	<h1>Cheesy Brocoli Pasta</h1>
	<img src="../images/pasta.jpg">
	<h2>Description:</h2>
	<p>This is one of my best emergency quick dinner ideas and 2-in-1 veg plus carb side dish. Broccoli, pasta and not much else, itâ€™s a little bit lemony, a little bit cheesy and a whole lot of yum. 
	   The broccoli is cooked with the pasta then stirred vigorously with sauce to make it juicy and saucy
	</p>
	<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>280g penne</li>
			<li>280g broccoli, cut into florets</li>
			<li>25g butter</li>
			<li>25g plain flour</li>
			<li>300ml milk</li>
			<li>1 tbsp wholegrain mustard</li>
			<li>140g mature cheddar, grated</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>Steps:</h2>
		<ol>
		
			<li>Cook the pasta, adding the broccoli for the final 4-5 mins and cooking until tender. Drain well, then heat the grill.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Heat the butter in a saucepan and stir in the flour. Cook for 1 min, then gradually add the milk, stirring well between each addition. 
			Bring to the boil, stirring, then simmer for 2 mins, before stirring in the mustard, half the cheese and seasoning.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Mix the pasta and broccoli into the sauce and spoon into an ovenproof dish. Scatter over the remaining cheese and place under a hot grill for 3-4 mins until golden and bubbling.</li>
