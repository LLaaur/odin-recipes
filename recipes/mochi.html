	<h2>Description:</h2>
	<p>Mochi are small, sweet Japanese cakes made with glutinous rice flour (mochiko). 
	   They have a soft, chewy outer layer and a deliciously sticky filling made of sweetened red bean paste. Freezing the red bean paste before you use it is optional but it does make the process easier.
